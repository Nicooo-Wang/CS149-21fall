## Program 4: Iterative `sqrt`

1. Build and run `sqrt`. Report the ISPC implementation speedup for single CPU core (no tasks) and when using all cores (with tasks). What is the speedup due to SIMD parallelization? What is the speedup due to multi-core parallelization?

   Answer : I achieved 3.77x speedup from trivial ISPC and 98.67x speedup from 64 task ISPC. i.e. 3.77x speedup due to SIMD parallelization and 26.17x speedup due to multi-core parallelization.

2. Modify the contents of the array values to improve the relative speedup of the ISPC implementations. Construct a specifc input that **maximizes speedup over the sequential version of the code** and report the resulting speedup achieved (for both the with- and without-tasks ISPC implementations). Does your modification improve SIMD speedup? Does it improve multi-core speedup (i.e., the benefit of moving from ISPC without-tasks to ISPC with tasks)? Please explain why.

   Answer : I construct an array with all the elements equal 2.998. Since all the elements are equal, each lane requires the same iteration, leads to no-mask in the SIMD parallelization. Also, 2.998 requires much more computation which will saturate the CPU and compensate for the multi-threading overhead in the task version. I achieved 5.58x speedup from ISPC and 144.70x speedup from task ISPC.

3. Construct a specific input for `sqrt` that **minimizes speedup for ISPC (without-tasks) over the sequential version of the code**. Describe this input, describe why you chose it, and report the resulting relative performance of the ISPC implementations. What is the reason for the loss in efficiency? **(keep in mind we are using the `--target=avx2` option for ISPC, which generates 8-wide SIMD instructions)**.

   Answer : I construct an array with all the elements equal 1 except for those whose index is multiples of 8 which equal 2.998. For this input, I achieve 0.78x speedup from ISPC, which is worse than the serial case.
